# Professional README Generator

## Description

Every good project deserves a good README with information about the app so the users can install , run and contribute the app. Contributions of others helps to improve a bug free and better application.

This is a command-line application that runs with Node.js then generates a README.md file based on input of the user about the project. Find the README.md under the Develop in the repo to see a sample generated readme file. Screenshot of sample file added below.
